She found a place for her wooden box, painted with red hearts and the Egyptian flag, alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community.\n\n""If it wasn\'t for my mother, I would have been on the streets"" Houda, her daughter, told TV host Mona al-Shazly through tears. ""Honestly I would have been in the streets. I did not find a home except with my mother. And even today my children rely on her.""\n\nThe years of sun and sand weathered and darkened Dahou\'s face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man. Her only child, Houda, eventually married and had two children of her own.\n\nThrough the years the one-time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day, a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes.  After her interview on CBC television, the governor of Luxor province offered Dahou a kiosk and a cash advance. The maverick had one requirement- she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire.\n\n""Even if I die, I will not take it off,"" Dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a TV camera, ""When I had to dress in a woman\'s jalabiya when I went to Cairo I felt suffocated. No, I thank God. I don\'t want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter.""\n\nNow the 65-year-old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman. Egypt\'s President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, crowned her as one of Egypt\'s ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month.\n\n""If I was really a man, I would not have done this,"" Dahou told her daughter, ""I would have gotten remarried. I would have left you who knows where. You would have been treated without dignity or left homeless. Thank God I was able to protect you.""'}","{'text': ""A widow at just 21, Sissa Abu Dahou was forced to fend for herself in Egypt's patriarchal south..

The study also found that governments that intervene to help the unemployed find work made people more likely to say they wanted work even if they didn't need the money\n\n'When a 'critical mass' of individuals receive public benefits rather than engaging in paid work, the norms regulating work and benefit behaviour will weaken, setting off a self-reinforcing process towards the 'self-destruction' of the welfare state.  \n\nThey also said that this may be because people who receive generous benefits when out of work may feel more inclined to give something back to the state by striving hard to find work. \n\n'The notion that big welfare states are associated with widespread cultures of dependency, or other adverse consequences of poor short term incentives to work, receives little support.' \n\nThe paper was published in the journal Work, Employment and Society.""}","{'text': 'A study of 19,000 people in 19 countries found that the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick, and invested in employment schemes, the more likely its residents were to want a job.

She admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family, but she said it was worth it.\n\nSince August, Davion has been spending weekends with Connie and her daughters, Sydney, 21, Carley, 17, and with her adopted son Taylor, who is now 14.\n\nThen in December, Going took the steps to begin the adoption process and Davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home. \n\nSince then there have fights and tables have been flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges.\n\n'I'm okay with messy and difficult,' she told the Tampa Bay Times. 'You just have to have your armor on all the time, but it's more than worth it. And every day things get a little bit better.' \n\nDavion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church: 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.'\n\nHe then said: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.'\n\nDavion Only, 16, has been adopted by his old case worker, Connie Bell Going in Florida (above). She has known the teen since he was seven years old. Davion had been in the foster care system his entire life\n\nDavion (above) captured hearts  in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a St Petersburg church congregation for a family to 'love him forever'\n\nMost of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever'.\n\nMillions of people around the country soon heard about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family.\n\nThat is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system.\n\nAfter Davion returned, people kept asking Going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months.\n\n'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong,' she said.\n\nMaking matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida.\n\nDavion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year.\n\nDavion Only (pictured above with Connie Going at the church where he made his speech in 2013) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children\n\nGoing says she had begun to call him numerous times, but he always hung up the phone.\n\nThen, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy.\n\n'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said. 'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?'\n\nFor the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear.\n\nThe 52-year-old case worker has three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier.\n\nFrom August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Taylor.\n\nThen, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. \n\nDavion Only (pictured above in church three years ago) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July\n\nDavion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along.\n\n'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' \n\nDavion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their birthdays, which fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers.\n\nAfter 16 years Davion was finally home. \n\nWhat's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well. \n\n'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion (above in 2013) said to Going last December""}","{'text': ""Davion Navar Henry Only, 16, has been adopted by his old case worker, Connie Bell Going, and her family.

The theatre director intended to retire to the property \n\nNow the council has won the right to force Miss Walford to use the equity in the house, where she intended to retire, for care home fees, which can be up to £600 a week.\n\nSolicitors warned that the case could pave the way for relatives across the country to be liable for their parents\' care.\n\nCharlotte Kelly, an associate at Worcestershire legal firm Kerwoods, said: \'This was a very significant judgment and one which will affect many in similar situations.\'\n\nWhen her mother Mary Walford, now aged 100, was admitted into care in 2006, the council agreed that the house in Stourport-on-Severn should not be taken into account during means testing.\n\nBut in 2013 they reversed their decision and said that Miss Walford would need to begin contributing towards bills. Frustrated by the U-turn, Miss Walford became embroiled in a legal battle with the council which was taken to the High Court in January 2014.\n\nMiss Walford said she had always planned to retire to her mother\'s house in Stourpour-upon-Severn (above) \n\nThere, a judge ruled that her home should not be taken into account when means testing was carried out on her mother\'s finances. In his ruling, Justice Supperstone concluded: \'A ""home"" is a place to which a person has a degree of attachment both physical and emotional.\'\n\nBut the council took the case to the Court of Appeal, arguing that although the property may be her home, it was not at the time her mother was taken into care. Yesterday Miss Walford said: \'I am now in a position where I will almost certainly have to sell my home to pay for my mother\'s care bills which will leave me homeless. I have no energy or money left to fight them.\'\n\nSunnydene has been in the family for decades and was built by her grandmother\'s aunt in the mid-1800s. Miss Walford\'s car is parked in the drive, her belongings fill the bedrooms and she has an office where she carries out her work.\n\nYet she is often posted across the globe and, when working on national productions, needs to be based in London. As a result Miss Walford rents a bedsit owned by a friend in the centre of the capital.\n\nMiss Walford, who has never married and has no children, said: \'Sunnydene is my home. I have lived there since I was 13.\n\n\'I pay council tax, the electricity bills and have spent £42,000 renovating it. It was always my intention to retire in the house.\n\nA judge at the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Worcestershire County Council in January. Earlier the High Court (above) had sided with the Walford family \n\n\'It is quite simply my home and it is going to be sold from underneath me. God knows how many other people will face the same heartache following this ruling.\' In the Court of Appeal hearing on December 9 last year, her barrister Fraser Campbell argued that the only reason his client did not permanently live at Sunnydene was because her work ties her to London.\n\nBy saying that the house would have been Miss Walford\'s residence had she not worked in London, the council was discouraging people over the age of 60 from working, Mr Campbell argued.\n\nDespite the submissions, two out of three judges ruled in the council\'s favour. Lord Justice McCombe, who rejected the council\'s appeal, said he saw \'no reason\' to assess whether the property was Miss Walford\'s home based on a \'historic\' date.\n\nYesterday a Worcestershire Council spokesman said: \'This was an important legal challenge and we are pleased that the Court of Appeal ruled in our favour.\n\n\'There are ever increasing demands being made on the public purse and it is important that decisions about how public money is used to support individuals are fair and consistent.\''}","{'text': ""A woman In her 70s may be forced to sell her childhood home to fund her elderly mother's care after losing a landmark Court case which could have implications for families across Britain."", 'policy': 'sup4_ppo_rm4_t.7', 'note': 'Summary looks good.', 'axes': {'overall': 7, 'accuracy': 7, 'coverage': 7, 'coherence': 7, 'compatible': None}}",gMlGeJl1vsMERrbmC7W717zpVevUh8,cnndm1,test,"POST:
