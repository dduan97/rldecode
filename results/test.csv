So I dated this girl for 9 months and we broke up in September. We started to talk recently and became friends. We have talked and I admitted I still like her and would be with her if I had the chance but I know I don't so I don't worry about it and live my life.

Problem is, whenever I see her she is seducing me. She convinced me to get a hotel room with her, when I see her she makes out with me or grabs my hair and pulling my head down and kissing my neck. She claims she has no feelings for me but calls and texts me every day and we talk about everything from if she is sad to just casual stuff  and every time I see her she can't seem to keep her hands off me. She also talks about how she wants to be the best I have had.

Now I am fine with this casual hookup because we are great friends and we are just having fun, but her behavior is really starting to confuse me.

We would bond over our love of gaming and Skype/text everyday. The first one was 2012-2013 and the second one was 2013-2014.

I have been doing online school for two years; I used to go to a public highschool and I'm very shy. I don't talk a lot, I pretty much have social anxiety and it's hard for me to go up to people that I don't know.

I don't like the feeling of when someone says hey, I can't say it back, or I do and I get so anxious because I can't carry a conversation. I want to be able to feel confident to make friends, especially ones in my repeated grade (supposed to be a senior, but I'm still a junior.)

I feel like my social skills are the one thing that keeps me away from happiness most of the time, and well, I think it would be nice to legitly have a boyfriend for once. I haven't even experienced anything, and I feel partly like I'm missing out.

I go back to my public school in September. Do you have any tips to overcome shyness? And I guess, how did you meet your girlfriend/boyfriend in school? Thank you in advance.

I'm a gamer who always met guys on the internet. Within the past few years, I've been in a two serious long distance relationships that haven't worked out. Each one lasting a year. We would bond over our love of gaming and Skype/text everyday. The first one was 2012-2013 and the second one was 2013-2014.
